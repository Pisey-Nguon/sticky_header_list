# Load More Issue - Fix Summary

## Problem
When loading the first 10 items (offset 0), they displayed correctly. However, when loading the next 10 items (offset 10), they didn't appear on screen even though the API call completed successfully.

## Root Cause
The issue was in `StickyHeaderAdapter.kt` lines 62-75. The merge logic was **inverted**:
- It only added items when there was a **duplicate header** (same date)
- It did **nothing** when there was a **new header** (different date)

Since offset 0 has date "2025-04-11" and offset 10 has date "2025-04-12", the new items were never added because the code didn't handle the "new header" case.

## What Was Fixed

### StickyHeaderAdapter.kt
Corrected the merge logic to properly handle three scenarios:

1. **Duplicate Header (same date)**: Skip the duplicate header and merge items under the existing one
2. **New Header (different date)**: Add everything (new header + its items)
3. **No Header**: Just add the items

### Added Comprehensive Logging
Both `MainActivity.kt` and `StickyHeaderAdapter.kt` now have detailed logs to track:
- What data is being loaded
- How items are being grouped
- How items are being merged into the list
- The list size before and after updates

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### On First Load (offset 0):
```
MainActivity: loadMoreData called with offset: 0
MainActivity: fetchDataFromApi returned 10 items
MainActivity: After grouping: 11 items (headers + items)
MainActivity:   [0] Header: 2025-04-11
MainActivity:   [1] Item: Remote Item 1 (2025-04-11)
MainActivity:   [2] Item: Remote Item 2 (2025-04-11)
...
MainActivity:   [10] Item: Remote Item 10 (2025-04-11)
```

### On Second Load (offset 10):
```
MainActivity: loadMoreData called with offset: 10
MainActivity: fetchDataFromApi returned 10 items
MainActivity: After grouping: 11 items (headers + items)
MainActivity:   [0] Header: 2025-04-12
MainActivity:   [1] Item: Remote Item 1 (2025-04-12)
...
StickyHeaderAdapter: Received 11 new items to add
StickyHeaderAdapter: Added new header '2025-04-12' and 10 items
StickyHeaderAdapter: List size: 11 -> 22 (added 11 items)
```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Install the app** on your device/emulator
2. **Launch the app** - You should see 10 items under "2025-04-11" header
3. **Scroll to the bottom** - A loading indicator should appear
4. **Wait ~4.5 seconds** - The next 10 items should appear under "2025-04-12" header
5. **Check Logcat** - Filter by "MainActivity" or "StickyHeaderAdapter" to see detailed logs

## What to Look For

✅ **Success indicators:**
- Total of 20 items visible (10 under each date header)
- Loading indicator appears and disappears properly
- Logs show "Added new header '2025-04-12' and 10 items"
- List size increases from 11 to 22

❌ **If still having issues:**
- Check if logs show "Received 11 new items to add"
- Verify the list size actually changes in logs
- Check for any exceptions in Logcat
